# Activity-Recognition-Feature-Analysis-Hypothesis-Based-Feature-Significance-Testing
This project analyzes motion sensor data (e.g., head, wrist, and foot rotations) to identify statistically significant features for human activity classification. Using **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**, it tests whether features like `Head_Rx`, `L_Wrist_Ry`, etc., vary significantly across different activities.
